# Orion Core

Orion is an open source framework built on Meteor that makes complex as well as simple apps possible with minimal effort.

This is an official subpackage for the super awesome Orion CMS framework. This is not a standalone app you must use as part of the framework.
[Orionjs.org](http://orionjs.org) has all the guides and hand holding you need to build simple and complex apps on meteor.

Orion is the first and perhaps the only structurally organized framework for meteor that takes care of security, scaling, support and performance. It is a plug and play solution backed by a core team of seasoned developers. Code examples, tutorials and documentation makes Orionjs the definite framework to use for your next project.
